        The process of making websites and hosting them on the internet is quite a bit complex but I'll expain it by dividing it into three basic sections.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="work2">
    <p>
        The first stage is where a programmer like myself writes the code that defines the website in his local computer
   <br><br>
        The second is where he uploads the code to a repository hosting service  such as ;
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>  and so on . . .</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>These services take the codes on the local computer and store it on the cloud where it can easily be accessed for runtime on the server.</p>
    </p>
</div>

    With both stages one and two running, the content of the website can be fully uploaded on the internet. However, the third and final stage is a very important and necessary one when a programmer is dealing with a real life situation website. This is where we buy the domain names. <br>
    Now, what is a domain name, it isn't what you haven't seen before. The names of websites ending with .com, .net, .org e.t.c are domains e.g netnaija.com, 9jarocks.com and the likes.
    You wouldn't want your website to look so long and weird like some of the links in the previous section so that's why a domain name is necessary. Also, I won't be creating a website for someone unless the person is ready to buy a domain name.

    <h3 class="text-center">Pricing</h3>
    <p>
    So this is where pricing comes in but I'm not going to give a specific range of prices for which I can get a job done for you, You may have to have shown interest and contacted me on my social media platforms before I go into those details.<br>
    However, there are some basic costs that any one who's ready to own a website would have to cover on their own exclusive of my workmanship and it all goes down to the domain name buying. After that, we can discuss my own payment rate.<br>
    In buying a domain, there are usually three things that are involved
    <ul>
    <li>The domain name itself</li>
    <li>SSL Certificates</li>
    <li>Protection services from malware and hackers depending on the place you're buying a domain from.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The domain name ofcourse itself is the main deal and must be bought, the other things listed are optional and come with additional cost but improved security to the website.<br>
    You'll get fuller details of this and more when you signify interest in getting a website
