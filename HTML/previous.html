        Of course,it wouldn't be just enough to say I can do something without proof of it<br>
        That is why I've decided to include a few of my works which you would be able to click on in the links that follow<br>
        Happpy viewing!😅

      First off is a website I designed to address the science topic; "heat"<br>
      At that point, I could say i was a bit of semi-skilled 😅.<br>
      It was a simple project and as such with not much complexities, you can click the link below <br>

      The second one is also a on a science topic <br>
      This one being on "Rate of Reactions"<br>
      I know you might be wondering already but pardon me, I'm just the science guy 😅.<br>

      The third one below is however a twist to it😁.

      Here, I worked on something looking more like a real website<br>
      It was one of my coding assignments though<br>
      You'd want to see this, trust me<br>

     All that goes to show my rising through the ranks as I began programming<br>
     And quite well, you know that the story doesn't end there, I think I still owe you a website 😎😂 <br>
     Let's write this story together, would you?😁<br>
     Less I forget, that reminds me, this is also one of the websites I have created and how do you see it ? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Yeah, that's right, Awesome!😁
    <br>
      The url's to these websites above follow a kind of weird pattern, popular websites you have probably heard of before look something like abc.com, abc.org or abc.net and so on and that is how they should be. <br> So how is is that these url's above don't follow that pattern and how does everything work out and become available on the internet, the next section is about that.
