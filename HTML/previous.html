        Of course,it wouldn't be just enough to say I can do something without proof of it<br>
        That is why I've decided to include a few of my works which you would be able to click on in the links that follow<br>
        Happpy viewing!😅

      First off is a website I designed to address the science topic; "heat"<br>
      At that point, I could say i was a bit of semi-skilled 😅.<br>
      It was a simple project and as such with not much complexities, you can click the link below <br>

      The second one is also a on a science topic <br>
      This one being on "Rate of Reactions"<br>
      I know you might be wondering already but pardon me, I'm just the science guy 😅.<br>

      Here, I worked on something looking more like a real website<br>
      It was one of my coding assignments tho<br>

     All that goes to show my rising through the ranks as I began programming<br>
     And quite well, you know that the story doesn't end there, I think I still owe you a website 😎😂 <br>
     Let's write this story together, would you?😁<br>
     Less I forget, that reminds me, this is also one of the websites I have created and how do you see it ? . . .Yeah, that's right, Awesome!😁
    <br>
        Now, you might have observed the funky url pattern in the websites I've created<br>
        Well, not too worry, that isn't how i'm going to make your website for you<br>
        The reason why that is I shall explain in the next section
